The main variables of interest in this study are the AQI of PM2.5 and O3 and the number of COVID-19 cases and lockdown measures. The AQI will be measured in micrograms per cubic meter (Âµg/m3), and the number of COVID-19 cases and lockdown measures will be measured in counts. Other variables, such as weather conditions, will also be considered in the analysis.
